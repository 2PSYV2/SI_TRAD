## Use
- To use the script you must include you own API keys for each of the models. To do so you must copy the structure of ".env.example" and create your own .env in the root directory
- You might need to install the dependencies if you did not previosly. Allof them are inside the "reuierements.txt" file and can be installed automatically via: pip install -r requirements.txt
If using the latter option it is recommended to create a local python enviorment using venv: python -m venv venv
- To get you API keys to run the program you must get key from Openrouter: https://openrouter.ai/
